Module displaying a xkcd drawing (random or specific)
=====================================================

I always wanted to be able to browse through xkcd drawings without
having to open a web browser for that.

I know there are a lot of solutions out there doing exactly that,
but I just feel like writing my own.

Also, I was bored :)
